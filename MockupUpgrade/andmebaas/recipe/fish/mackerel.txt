2.Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, heat a glug of oil and fry the red onions for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and tomato purée, fry for a few minutes, then add the red wine. Bubble for 2 minutes, then add the chopped tomatoes and basil. Cook for 10 minutes, then season.
3.Remove the skin from a the mackerel fillets and break up into bite-size pieces. Stir into the pan with the remaining basil and light crème fraîche. Spoon into a 2 litre baking dish (or keep in the pan if it’s ovenproof) and top with grated mature cheddar. Cook in the oven for 20-25 minutes until golden and piping hot throughout.
