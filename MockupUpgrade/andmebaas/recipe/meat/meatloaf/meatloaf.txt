1.Cook the lardons in a dry frying pan over a medium heat until well browned and crispy. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and set aside. Put the breadcrumbs in a large bowl. Beat the egg and milk together in a jug, then pour over the breadcrumbs. Leave to stand for 10 minutes.
2.Stir in the mustard, dried herbs, nutmeg, onion, celery, parsley and cooked lardons. Add the minced meats, season and mix well. Pack the mixture into a 2kg loaf tin. Cover the whole tin with foil and chill for at least 4 hours or overnight to firm up.
3.Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan160°C/gas 4. Take the loaf tin out of the fridge, uncover and press down firmly. Re-cover and cook in the oven for 45-50 minutes.
4.Meanwhile, make the sauce. Fry the onions, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until soft and golden. Sprinkle over the sugar and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the garlic and tomato purée and cook for a further 5 minutes. Add the stock and ale, bring to the boil and bubble for about 6-7 minutes to reduce by a third. Finally, mix in the cornflour paste and simmer for 1 minute, stirring until thickened. Season to taste, then set aside and keep warm.
5.Take the meatloaf out of the oven and leave to stand for 10 minutes before turning out of the tin and slicing. Serve with a good dollop of mash and some steamed greens, and the sauce poured over the top.
