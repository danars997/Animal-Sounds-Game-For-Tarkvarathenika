1.Put the potatoes in a large pan of cold water, bring to the boil and cook on a medium heat for 15-20 minutes until tender. Drain well, then lightly crush with a fork. Toss with 1 tbsp of the oil and 1 tbsp of the chopped oregano and season with salt and pepper.
2.Heat a non-stick frying pan. Brush the steaks with oil and season well. Sear for 3-4 minutes each side (or until cooked to your liking), then set aside on a plate to rest. When rested, slice across the grain into 2cm thick strips.
3.Warm the remaining oil and the garlic in the frying pan for 2-3 minutes, then add the vinegar and season with salt and pepper to make a warm dressing. After a minute, stir in the remaining oregano. 
4.Arrange the sliced tomatoes on 4 plates. Top with the rocket, sliced steak, dressing and parmesan shavings. Serve with the potatoes.
