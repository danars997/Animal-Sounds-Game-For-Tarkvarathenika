1.Before your friends arrive, make the croutons for the salad. Preheat the oven to 200°C/fan 180°C/gas 6. Cut the crusts off the bread, then cut the bread into pieces. Put into a roasting tin, sprinkle with the garlic, olive oil and a little sea salt, and mix together. Cook for 10 minutes. Cool and put into a sealed container until you need them.
2.Put the lettuce into a colander and rinse under cold running water. Shake dry, then put into a sealed container and chill until needed.
3.Take a bowl and put in a handful of lettuce leaves (tearing any large leaves). Sprinkle with the croutons.
4.Drag a vegetable peeler over the Parmesan and let a few shavings fall into your salad. Drizzle over some caesar salad dressing and eat.
